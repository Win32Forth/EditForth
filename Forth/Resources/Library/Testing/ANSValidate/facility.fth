\ facility.fth — ANS Facility + Facility Ext spot-checks
\
\ Requires: tester.fth already loaded
\ Structures (BEGIN-STRUCTURE / +FIELD / FIELD: / CFIELD:) — Hayes facilitytest subset.
\ Facility Ext: K-* constants, EKEY>FKEY / EKEY>CHAR (synthetic events).
\ Light MS / TIME&DATE smoke. Skip PAGE/AT-XY buffer capture (host UI).
\
\ NOT a formal ANS certificate. Prefer Hayes facilitytest.fth.
