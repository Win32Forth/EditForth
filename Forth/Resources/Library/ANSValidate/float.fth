\ float.fth -- ANS Float Tier A/B spot-checks (FLOATING vocabulary)
\
\ Requires: tester.fth already loaded
\ Float words live in the FLOATING wordlist: ALSO FLOATING before use.
\ Prefer Hayes fp/ suite for deep coverage (paranoia, ttester).
\
\ CRITICAL: no interpret-time IF/ELSE/THEN/BEGIN.
\ NOT a formal ANS certificate.
