\ host.fth — high-ROI TZForth FTEST / ANS-VALIDATE spots not covered elsewhere
\
\ Port of selected TestTZForth.swift TEST6 checks as pure Forth EXPECT cases.
\ Also: ANS hide-until-; (NFA SMUDGE), SMUDGE/REVEAL, CREATE visibility.
\ Requires: tester.fth already loaded (and kernel with fixed ABORT" / SLITERAL).
\
\ CRITICAL: no interpret-time IF/ELSE/THEN/BEGIN.
\ NOT a formal ANS certificate. Prefer Hayes for deep coverage.
