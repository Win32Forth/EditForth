64Forth ANS-VALIDATE (Library, pure Forth)
==========================================

Purpose
-------
Port of TZForth ANS-VALIDATE / FTEST spot-checks into pure Forth, one word
set at a time. Not a formal ANS certificate. Hayes stays under HayesTest/.

See PORT-PLAN.txt for the full module roadmap.

Canonical run
-------------
  FROMLIB FLOAD ANSValidate/ANS-VALIDATE.fth

  Library sources live in the Xcode project under
    64Forth/Resources/Library/
  and are copied into the app bundle at
    Contents/Resources/Library/
  on every build - same model as TZForth. FROMLIB resolves under that
  bundle Library, independent of the session cwd - Documents, home, etc.

  After editing .fth files: rebuild/run in Xcode so the bundle is refreshed.
  Nested FLOAD inside ANS-VALIDATE.fth uses the driver's folder - ANSValidate/ -
  so sibling modules need no absolute paths.

Expected
--------
  ANS-VALIDATE: N passed, 0 failed.
  ALL PASS
  === ANS-VALIDATE driver done ===

  Approximate count after host.fth (v0.8.2): mid-370s EXPECT cases.
  TZForth FTEST logs ~427 including Swift host-only checks — not a 1:1 goal.

  core-ext.fth   Core Ext - VALUE TO DEFER CASE COMPILE, BUFFER: …
  search.fth     Search-Order - WORDLIST ALSO ONLY VOCABULARY …
  string.fth     String - COMPARE SEARCH /STRING CMOVE …
  facility.fth   Facility + Facility Ext - structures, MS, K-*/EKEY>FKEY
  exception.fth  Exception - CATCH THROW
  memory.fth     Memory-Allocation - ALLOCATE FREE RESIZE

  xchar.fth      Extended Character UTF-8
  float.fth      Float Tier A/B - ALSO FLOATING vocabulary
  host.fth       High-ROI TZForth FTEST ports (FIND, POSTPONE, SLITERAL,
                 MARKER, 2!/2@, SIGN, REQUIRED/INCLUDED, EMIT?/EKEY?,
                 double literals, {:} order, FALIGNED/FATAN2/FLITERAL,
                 GD8 +LOOP, compile ABORT")

Standalone XChar only
---------------------
  FROMLIB FLOAD ANSValidate/all-in-one.fth

CRITICAL 64Forth rules
----------------------
  - No IF/ELSE/THEN/BEGIN while interpreting - only inside colon defs
  - .( stops at the first ) - no nested parentheses in messages

Layout
------
  ANS-VALIDATE.fth   multi-module driver - FROMLIB entry point
  PORT-PLAN.txt      word-set port order
  tester.fth         harness
  core.fth … float.fth  word-set modules
  host.fth           extra FTEST port wave (see above)
  all-in-one.fth     self-contained XChar suite
  run-from-disk.fth  alias → FROMLIB FLOAD ANSValidate/ANS-VALIDATE.fth
  probe / bisect / hello   diagnostics
