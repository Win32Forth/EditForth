# Emitter stand-alone app kit (GRAPHICS)

**Copies:** `Resources/Docs/APPKIT.md` and `Library/Emitter/APPKIT.md` (keep in sync).

**Emitter version:** **0.7** (stand-alone GRAPHICS emit; tetra + PIMAIN verified as `.app`).  
**Status:** design freeze for the window/IO surface (2026-09-05); packaging path live as of 2026-09-06; SA locals/BI + window I/O remap in **0.7** (2026-09-07).  
**Menus** and **File-Access-in-kit** are deferred.  
**First emit target:** `tetra/tetra.fth` (64TCOM tree) — interactive GRAPHICS + stand-alone `EMIT-WINDOW-APP` → `TETRA.app`. Also `PI/pi-chudnovsky.fth` → `PIMAIN.app`.

This document names the runtime base that Emitter-built stand-alone apps will sit on. It is **not** a second GUI toolkit: it is the existing **GRAPHICS** vocabulary plus host `(APP-*)` hooks, with room for a later **MENUS** vocabulary.

---

## Product workflow

1. Write and debug the app on **interactive 64Forth** with `ONLY FORTH ALSO GRAPHICS` (char grid + optional points).
2. When Emitter can emit a stand-alone image, slice/link that app against the same GRAPHICS surface (host still provides the AppKit window).
3. Do **not** depend on the IDE console, Facility/`PAGE`, SZ-EDITOR, or Hyper for the stand-alone product path.

Entry pattern (unchanged): load sources, then `MAIN` (AutoLoad may call `APP-RUN`).

## Window / IO surface (in kit now)

### Dimensions (frozen for now)

| Layer | Size |
|--------|------|
| Char grid | **80 × 25** (`G-COLS` / `G-ROWS`) |
| Pixels | **640 × 400** (`G-PX` / `G-PY` = 80×8 × 25×16) |
| Cell | 8 × 16 px |

### Pixel depth (selectable)

| Mode word | `G-DEPTH` | Buffer | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| `1BIT` (default) | 1 | packed bits (~32 KB used) | Host paints set bits as green-on-black |
| `COLOR8` | 8 | 1 byte/pixel (~256 KB) | Palette indices; 0–15 = classic TCOLOR |
| `TRUECOLOR` | 32 | 4 bytes/pixel BGRA (~1 MiB) | Pen = `$00RRGGBB` via `RGB` / `COLOR !` |

`G-PIX` is allotted for truecolor once so depth switches need no `RESIZE`. `G-PIXBYTES` is the used size at the current depth.

**Ink** (`WHITE` `BLACK` `INVERT`) remain **modes** (set / clear / xor), not palette names. **Pen** is `COLOR` (index in `COLOR8`, `$00RRGGBB` in `TRUECOLOR`). Classic indices: `CBLACK`…`CWHITE`. Pack truecolor with `r g b RGB`.

Host draw uses a CGImage stretch (not per-pixel rect fills). Char overlay stays green; spaces leave pixels visible.

### Image load (interactive host)

`(APP-IMG-CHOOSE)` / `(APP-IMG-LOAD)` / `(APP-IMG-SIZE)` / `(APP-IMG-RENDER)` decode any format `NSImage` supports (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, …) into a host BGRA cache, then sample into the Forth `TRUECOLOR` buffer. Zoom is `zoom100` (100 = 1:1) around an image-space center. Sample: `Library/Sample/IMAGEVIEW64.fth` → `IMAGEVIEW`. Interactive Swift host and Emitter `emit-run` both implement slots **17–20** (NSOpenPanel / path load / render). SA also accepts `--image PATH`, a second argv path, or drag-drop onto the window (staged path consumed by OPEN / choose).

`(APP-FILE-CHOOSE)` / `(APP-FILE-SAVE-AS)` / `(APP-FILE-PATH)` / `(APP-FILE-SLURP)` / `(APP-FILE-SPEW)` stage a path via NSOpenPanel/NSSavePanel then read/write bytes (slots **21–25**). Sample: `Library/Sample/EDIT64.fth` → `EDIT64`. Keeps ANS File-Access out of the emit reach graph.

### Forth words (GRAPHICS)

Char / IO: `WINDOW` `WINDOW-OFF` `APP-NAME` `CLS` `AT` `EMIT` `TYPE` `SPACE` `CR` `.` `."` `GET-CHAR` `KEY` `KEY?` `REFRESH` `?REFRESH`

Time / sound: `TIME-RESET` `10TH-ELAPSED` `TENTHS` `TONE`

Mouse: `G-MOUSE` / `GETMOUS` → `(APP-MOUSE)` — `( -- x y buttons )`, PLOT origin (bottom-left); buttons `1`=left `2`=right `4`=middle

Points: `1BIT` `COLOR8` `TRUECOLOR` `WHITE` `BLACK` `INVERT` `COLOR` `RGB` `CBLACK`…`CWHITE` `PLOT` `UNPLOT` `LINE` `POINT@` `POINT-COLOR@` `PCLS` `PREFRESH`

Image (interactive): `(APP-IMG-CHOOSE)` `(APP-IMG-LOAD)` `(APP-IMG-SIZE)` `(APP-IMG-RENDER)`

Smoke: `GRAPHICS-SMOKE` `GRAPHICS-PSMOKE` `GRAPHICS-CSMOKE`

Samples: `Library/Sample/DOODLE64.fth` → `DOODLE` (1-bit); `Library/Sample/DOODLECOLOR64.fth` → `DOODLECOLOR` (COLOR8 + 16-color bar); `Library/Sample/IMAGEVIEW64.fth` → `IMAGEVIEW` (TRUECOLOR + file open / click zoom); `Library/Sample/EDIT64.fth` → `EDIT64` (1-bit mini-editor + `(APP-FILE-*)` panels)

### Host CODE ABI (must remain imports for Emitter)

`(APP-OPEN)` `(APP-CLOSE)` `(APP-BLIT)` `(APP-PBLIT)` `(APP-CBLIT)` `(APP-KEY?)` `(APP-KEY)` `(APP-NAME)` `(APP-TONE)` `(APP-PUMP)` `(APP-MOUSE)` `(APP-IMG-CHOOSE)` `(APP-IMG-LOAD)` `(APP-IMG-SIZE)` `(APP-IMG-RENDER)` `(APP-FILE-CHOOSE)` `(APP-FILE-SAVE-AS)` `(APP-FILE-PATH)` `(APP-FILE-SLURP)` `(APP-FILE-SPEW)` `(APP-SIZE?)` plus `MS@` for timers.

- `(APP-PBLIT) ( c-addr u -- )` — **1-bit only** (legacy SA).
- `(APP-CBLIT) ( c-addr u depth -- )` — depth `1` / `8` / `32`.
- `(APP-IMG-CHOOSE) ( -- ior )` — NSOpenPanel; `0` ok, `-1` cancel, `-2` fail.
- `(APP-IMG-LOAD) ( c-addr u -- ior )` — load UTF-8 path; `0` ok, `-2` fail.
- `(APP-IMG-SIZE) ( -- w h )` — natural pixels (`0 0` if none).
- `(APP-IMG-RENDER) ( c-addr w h cx cy zoom100 -- ior )` — sample into BGRA buffer.
- `(APP-FILE-CHOOSE) ( -- ior )` — NSOpenPanel; stages path; `0` ok, `-1` cancel, `-2` fail.
- `(APP-FILE-SAVE-AS) ( -- ior )` — NSSavePanel; stages path.
- `(APP-FILE-PATH) ( c-addr u -- u2 )` — copy staged UTF-8 path (`0` if none).
- `(APP-FILE-SLURP) ( c-addr max -- u ior )` — read staged file into buffer.
- `(APP-FILE-SPEW) ( c-addr u -- ior )` — write buffer to staged path.

Emitter `HOST-APP` slot table is append-only; `(APP-MOUSE)` **15**, `(APP-CBLIT)` **16**, `(APP-IMG-*)` **17–20**, `(APP-FILE-*)` **21–25**, `(APP-SIZE?)` **26** in `reloc.fth` / `emit-host.inc`. Stand-alone `TGT-BUILD` opens a **2 MiB** data arena (and **256 KiB** code) so TRUECOLOR `G-PIX` (~1 MiB) can import.

**`emit-run` binary:** the stand-alone runner at `Library/Emitter/runner/emit-run` is **gitignored** (build product). Sources are `emit-run.m` + `emit-host.inc` (tracked). After changing host slots or `emit-host.inc`, rebuild before `EMIT-WINDOW-APP` / `app-build.sh`:

```text
cd <Library>/Emitter/runner && ./build-run.sh
```

If emit packs an old runner, new slots (e.g. `(APP-FILE-*)`) are missing at launch. See also `Library/Emitter/runner/README.txt`.

Swift: `Host/AppOutputHost.swift`. Hooks live in the **GRAPHICS** vocabulary after cold `vocsys.fth` rechain.

Forth owns `G-BUF` / `G-PIX`; the host owns the `NSWindow`, blit, key queue, tone, and pump.

## Explicitly out of kit (for now)

| Deferred | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| **MENUS** vocabulary | Limited menu construction/handling — later |
| File-Access as Emitter kit fence | ANS file words already exist in the kernel/host; not part of this freeze |
| IDE surfaces | Console, Facility, SZ-EDITOR, Hyper, Tools menus |

---

## Triple-load line directives

Apps that also build under 64TCOM (and later Emitter) use line prefixes:

| Directive | When true | Typical use |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `\ANS` | Interactive **64Forth** | GRAPHICS `WINDOW-OFF`, stack HUD, etc. |
| `\TCOM` | **64TCOM** / `TARGETARM64` | Mach-O exit status, TCOM BYE paths |
| `\EMITTER` | Emitter-armed source load | Emitter-only lines in **shared** sources |

`DIRECTIVE` / `\ANS` / `\TCOM` / `\EMITTER` are defined in cold `Kernel/app-output.fth` (and mirrored under `Library/Sources/`). On interactive 64Forth: `\ANS` **true**, `\TCOM` and `\EMITTER` **false**.

**Shared app sources** (e.g. `tetra/tetra.fth`) are used by 64Forth, 64TCOM, **and** Emitter. Any line that is specific to one host must be prefixed with that directive so the others skip it. If Emitter-specific code is added to those shared files, it **must** start with `\EMITTER` (and the Emitter load path must arm `\EMITTER` true, typically with `\ANS`/`\TCOM` false for that include).

**Normal in-process slice** still develops under `\ANS` and copies already-compiled ITC (`TGT-BUILD` / `TGT-RUN`) without re-INCLUDING the app — so many emit sessions never need `\EMITTER` lines. Packaging / runner work belongs in `Library/Emitter/` and `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/`, not in shared tetra sources, unless a true triple-load difference appears.

Example (from tetra): Esc quits differently for TCOM vs interactive ANS:

```forth
\TCOM               $1B OF 0 23 AT BYE              ENDOF
\ANS                $1B OF WINDOW-OFF EXIT          ENDOF
\EMITTER            $1B OF WINDOW-OFF EXIT          ENDOF   \ only if Emitter exit must differ / be explicit
```

---

## First example: tetra

Canonical dual/triple-load source:

`/Users/thomaszimmer/Documents/64TCOM/64TCOMARM64/tetra/tetra.fth`

Interactive load sketch:

```forth
ONLY FORTH ALSO GRAPHICS
S" /Users/thomaszimmer/Documents/64TCOM/64TCOMARM64/tetra/tetra.fth" INCLUDED
MAIN
```

(Cold start already provides GRAPHICS; an extra `FLOAD` of `app-output` is unnecessary on current 64Forth.)

Emitter milestone: emit **tetra** as a stand-alone macOS app that still uses the GRAPHICS host window — after reach/copy covers what tetra needs and host `(APP-*)` stay as imports.

## Next (ordered)

1. Keep developing apps against GRAPHICS on 64Forth (tetra is the reference).
2. Grow Emitter reach/target so tetra’s colon graph + CODE imports build/run in-process.
   - **Done (in-process):** `DATA-WORD?` — CREATE / VALUE / DOVAR / DOCON / DODOES stay **host imports** (identity map); `CODE-BOUNDS` unknown aborts; smoke covers VALUE/`TO`, CREATE cell, `DO`/`LOOP` (`Emitter/test.fth`, `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/agent-smoke.fth`).
   - **Done (in-process):** branch-aware colon walk (so `IF EXIT THEN` in `WINDOW` still reaches `(APP-OPEN)`); reloc skips imports; GRAPHICS mini smoke `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/gfx-smoke.fth` (`APP-NAME`/`WINDOW`/`CLS`/`AT`/`."`/`WINDOW-OFF` via `TGT-BUILD`+`TGT-RUN`; under `--agent` the window does not open but `(APP-*)` still veneer).
   - **Done (in-process):** tetra subset + MAIN build — `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/tetra-smoke.fth` loads `64TCOMARM64/tetra/tetra.fth`, runs `T-TETRA-SUB` (FIELD/SETUP/BORDER/`FILL.CURR`/`DRAW.CURR`, no KEY loop), and `TGT-BUILD` of `MAIN` (~169 reachable). Does not run `GAME`’s KEY loop under agent.
   - **Done (howto):** interactive emit of `MAIN`/`GAME` — `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/tetra-gui-smoke.fth` builds `MAIN` under agent; from the GUI console run `EMIT-TETRA` (`TGT-BUILD`+`TGT-RUN`) for a real GRAPHICS window + KEY loop. ESC uses the existing `\ANS` `WINDOW-OFF EXIT` arms (play + game-over). Do not `TGT-RUN` under `--agent` (KEY blocks). User-verified: focus Graphics window, Space drops, ESC quits.
   - **Note:** `\EMITTER` line prefixes are required **when** Emitter-only code is added to shared sources (`tetra.fth`, etc.); normal ITC slice of `\ANS`-compiled words does not re-INCLUDE those files. Packaging code lives under `Library/Emitter/` / `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/`.
3. **Stand-alone packaging (in progress):**
   - **Done (Phase 1):** `/EMIT-STANDALONE` — copy reachable CREATE/VALUE/… into a RW data segment (`TGT-DATA-*`); `/EMIT-HOSTDATA` keeps identity map for interactive emit. Bundle recipe scaffold: `Library/Emitter/app-build.sh.template` (from TCOM `*-build.sh`). Smoke: `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/data-standalone-smoke.fth`.
   - **Done (Phase 2a, in-process):** relocatable `host_app_*` slots — `(APP-*)` out-of-span `BL`s get `LDR X16,.quad` / `BLR` veneers with `.quad = $C0DE…|slot`; `HOST-BIND` fills live VAs before `TGT-PROTECT`. Slots 0–8 = open/close/blit/pblit/keyq/key/name/tone/pump; **slot 9 = `MS@` → `gettimeofday`** (SA used to NOP that BL, freezing `10TH-ELAPSED` / tetra gravity). Smoke: `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/gfx-smoke.fth` asserts `HOST-RELOC-N` and bound quads; `timer-sa-smoke.fth` for stand-alone timer.
   - **Done (Phase 2b.1):** `64EMIT02` image persist — `/EMIT-UNBOUND` keeps `MAGIC|slot`; `SAVE-IMAGE` / `LOAD-IMAGE` (`Library/Emitter/save.fth`) write code+data+host reloc offsets+emit bases; load rebases ITC pointers and restores relocs; `TGT-RUN-LOADED` binds and runs. Smoke: `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/persist-smoke.fth`.
   - **Done (Phase 2b.2):** thin runner `Library/Emitter/runner/emit-run` (+ `emit-host.inc`) loads `64EMIT02`, binds host slots, runs ITC. Headless: `EMIT_HEADLESS=1`. Return gadget uses `adr` so `run_itc`’s C epilogue runs (saving caller LR alone skips it and breaks the stack). **`emit-run` is gitignored** — rebuild with `runner/build-run.sh` after slot/`emit-host` changes (see `runner/README.txt`).
   - **Done (Phase 2b.3):** `Library/Emitter/app-build.sh NAME image.img [out-dir]` bundles `emit-run` as `MacOS/NAME` + `Resources/app.img`. No-arg launch resolves the bundle image. Smoke: `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/gfx-app-smoke.sh` → `Gfx.app`.
   - **Done (Forth entry):** `EMIT-APP ( xt -- )` / `EMIT-APP-TO ( xt c-addr u -- )` in **FORTH** (`Library/Emitter/app.fth`) — `/EMIT-STANDALONE` + `/EMIT-UNBOUND` + `TGT-BUILD` + `SAVE-IMAGE` + `SYSTEM` `app-build.sh` (found via `LIBRARY-PATH`). App basename = word name. `' MAIN EMIT-APP` → `./MAIN.app`; **`FROMLIB ' MAIN EMIT-APP`** → `<LIBRARY-PATH>/MAIN.app`. Relative `EMIT-APP-TO` outdirs honor armed `FROMLIB`. Smoke: `Library/Emitter/EmitterSmoke/emit-app-smoke.fth`.
   - **Done:** `EMIT-WINDOW-APP` / `EMIT-WINDOW-APP-TO` — build a `:NONAME` headless main `S" STEM" APP-NAME WINDOW <xt> WINDOW-OFF ;` then pack. **STEM** = uppercase basename of `LAST-INCLUDED` (load the app `.fth` *after* Emitter). Example: include `tetra.fth`, then `' GAME EMIT-WINDOW-APP` → `TETRA.app`. Smoke: `EmitterSmoke/emit-window-app-smoke.fth`.
   - **Done:** `FROMLIB?` / `FROMLIB-OFF` / `LIBRARY-PATH` / `LAST-INCLUDED` — Forth-visible FROMLIB arm, Library root, and last INCLUDE/FLOAD path.
   - **Done:** `CATCH` / `(CATCH-OK)` / `THROW` have `CODE-BOUNDS`. **SA-EXCEPT** retargets their BSS ADRPs into RW `TGT-DATA` cells. **`EMIT-APP` / `EMIT-WINDOW-APP` auto-wrap with `CATCH`**; default `EMIT-ON-THROW` prints the code then **`KEY DROP`** so the user can read it before shutdown (override with `' MY-HANDLER IS EMIT-ON-THROW`). Raw `TGT-BUILD` still refuses `ABORT` without `CATCH`. Uncaught `THROW` never enters `QUIT`.
4. Later: **MENUS** vocab; document File-Access as part of the kit fence when stand-alone apps need declared file imports.
