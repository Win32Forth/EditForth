\ runfptests.fth — 64Forth / vendor FP suite driver (HARNESs, not a test)
\
\ Location: HayesTest/src/Harness/   (kept out of fp/ so suite sources stay clean)
\ Actual FP tests live in:          HayesTest/src/fp/
\
\ Named FLOAD sets cwd to this Harness/ folder, so test paths are
\ relative: ../fp/<file>
\
\ Note: inside colon definitions use ." or S" TYPE — not .(
\ .( is immediate and prints at compile time (causes false "noise" messages).

\ searchordertest can leave a odd order. FLOATING is the vocabulary;
\ filetest's CREATE FP is a buffer and is left alone.
