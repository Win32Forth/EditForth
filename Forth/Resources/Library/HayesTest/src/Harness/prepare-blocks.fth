\ prepare-blocks.fth — vendor harness (not an ANS test case)
\ Location: HayesTest/src/Harness/
\
\ App-bundled Resources/Library (including HayesTest/src/blocks.blk) is
\ read-only. Block tests need UPDATE/FLUSH, so select a writable .blk under
\ Application Support before blocktest.fth runs.
\
\ Path (~ expands via host FileAccess):
\   ~/Library/Application Support/64Forth/hayes-blocks.blk
\
\ Needs enough blocks for blocktest (FIRST-TEST-BLOCK=20 … LIMIT=30).
\ Creates 64 blocks if the file does not exist yet.
\
\ Note: use ." (compile-time string) not .( inside colon definitions.
\ .( is immediate and prints while the definition is being compiled.
